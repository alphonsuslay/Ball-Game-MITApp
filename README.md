# What the Project does
The project is a Pong ball game created using MIT app Inventor.
It is a ball game where users must prevent the ball from hitting the bottom of the space using a slider.

# How the Project Works
The project opens a start game screen called "Screen 1" which then allows the user to set their ball speed from 1-5 using a slider. Upon pressing the start button, it intializes another screen where the game is held. 

Clicking the "Sound On" checkbox will enable user to have audio generated when the ball hits either the slier or the top,left, or right edge of the screen. 
Pressing the start button will start the game with the ball from the top of the screen to fall down. The goal is to use the slider and bounce the ball back. Each successful bounce, +1 is added to the score and is displayed on the score counter on the bottom left.

If the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen, the game can no longer be played and the background will show a game over sign held by the cat.

To reset the game, simply press the Reset Button.
